# NativeScript Top 10

This is the demo app for my _10 Awesome Things You Can Build with NativeScript_ talk. You can find the slides for the talk [here](https://www.tjvantoll.com/speaking/slides/Top-10/Sofia/Top-10.pptx), and run the app for yourself by [setting up NativeScript](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup), and then executing `tns run ios` or `tns run android` from your terminal or command prompt.
